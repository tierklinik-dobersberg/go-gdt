# go-gdt

This repository contains a [Go](https://golang.org) module that allows to read and write GDT
(**G**eräte-**D**aten-**T**räger) files as commonly used to integrate various medical systems
(like integrating a clinic/practice EDP system to a PACS or DICOM worklist).

This module is not yet stable and should not be used in production!
